      <p>A key part of any brand &mdash; whether consumer or personal &mdash; is how the item is presented. A shiny, bright package on the shelf is more likely to attract the eye compared to something that is dull or difficult to see. We call this “brand image” (<a href="http://www.toxel.com/inspiration/2010/12/20/simplified-packaging/" title="Simplified Packaging" target="_blank">sometimes also called &quot;shelf appeal&quot; <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>). The same rules apply for you in your job search. Presenting yourself as a professional brand requires that you maintain a consistent image of professionalism when communicating with others, both in-person and online.</p>

          <h2>Make a Good Impression</h2>
          <p>You want to develop credibility when introducing yourself to others to &quot;make an impression&quot; and be remembered. If you are memorable, you have a better chance of making a connection that may help you on your career journey. Making a good impression and managing the impression you make on others are an important components of your personal brand management. </p>

          <h3>Making a Positive First Impression</h3>
          <p>When meeting another person, we quickly form an opinion of them. We decide if we like them or not, and whether we consider them to be professional. A common saying goes: &quot;You never get a second chance to make a good first impression.&quot; In face-to-face meetings, your impression will be set in two to four minutes. On the phone or web, it’s established in mere seconds. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5857432/how-to-make-and-sustain-a-good-first-impression-every-time" title="How to Make and Sustain a good first impression every time" target="_blank">Making positive impressions <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> will help you get what you want, while <a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/9-ways-to-fix-a-bad-first-impression.html" title="Nine Ways to fix a bad first impression" target="_blank">negative impressions are really hard to dispel <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.

          <h2>Engage Potential Employers</h2>
          <p>Think of a car ad that focuses on brake problems – would you buy? No. Focusing on your weaknesses creates the same problem. Now, think of a car ad that focuses on how a car used to rust easily but doesn’t anymore. Would you buy? No. Focusing on past hurdles may detract from your brand image. Stop thinking about successes and failures. Stop thinking about you. Start thinking about the person that’s buying the car. Focus on what they want. </p>
          <h3>Connecting Your Brand to Employer Interests</h3>
          <p>That’s the challenge. When you are engaging with potential employers, you need to connect your brand with their interests, values, preferences, and strengths. You don’t want to tell them just what they want to hear, but you need to figure out how to angle yourself to be most attractive to them. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One way to do this is to demonstrate a passion (connecting over a common interest, showing excitement, like an activity).</li>
            <li>Another way is to showcase competency (example: attending a talk and asking a great question).</li>
            <li>Try setting goals and communicating those goals with others (e.g., an entrepreneurial plan, a professional development goal, or a plan for personal improvement). </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Manage Your Online Image</h2>
          <p>As you learned in week 1, communicating via Internet-based technology has its advantages—allowing you to easily share information using an informal writing style. If not managed properly, however, it can give others a poor impression of you. That’s why it’s important to adhere to some common standards or &quot;ground rules&quot; for posting online to maintain a professional image with your contacts and potential employers.</p>
          <h3>Adopting Online Standards</h3>
          <p>When you are online, you need to remember that people can’t see you face to face and will form an impression of you based on your content. Adopting social media standards helps you to maintain a professional digital brand that leaves others with a more favourable impression of you. It also helps you to develop relationships with others. Here’s a list of <a href="http://www.binarytattoo.com/10-rules-to-post-by/" title="Ten Rules to Post By" target="_blank">ten rules <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> to consider before posting online.</p>
