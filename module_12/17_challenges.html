      		<p>Intentionally attracting and recruiting workers with a variety of characteristics and identities means having a workforce made up of people with different perspectives. Employers are increasingly seeking to improve diversity among their workers for the benefits associated with diversity and inclusion.</p>

                        <p>Employers are increasingly concerned with having diversity and inclusion in the workplace because:</p>

                            	<li>Having a workforce comprised of workers with multiple viewpoints presents opportunities to develop cross-functional teams with a broader variety of skills and experiences. Intercultural teams, for example, have been proven to be more adept at change management.</li>
                              <li>Diversity in the workplace represents the diversity in our communities and country. Employers can better reflect their clientele, and better communicate with external contacts.</li>
                              <li>Meeting legal obligations of employment equity, but enhancing inclusion meets the moral obligation of employers to have respectful workplaces.</li>
                              <li>A workplace that celebrates diversity and inclusion can have tangible benefits in terms of employee engagement, leading to a healthier organizational culture and more productive workers</li>

                        <p>However, diversity comes with challenges, specifically:</p>

                          	<li>Actual and perceived barriers to communication between employees, clients, leadership.</li>
                            <li>Increased importance on training, awareness, inclusive exercises; may be associated costs with training or time away from other work.</li>
                            <li>Focusing on CQ (Cultural Intelligence) means a shift in skills and values, especially for leadership. CQ could become a more important skill than previously thought, and leadership competency may not be in place to respond to diversity.</li>
                            <li>Some workers may be resistant to change. These workers could be resistant to others with alternative characteristics, and may not like any changes in the workplace culture. </li>
