You dislike direct confrontation and may seek other indirect methods of handling conflict, such as passive aggressive communication. This approach can be beneficial when an issue is inconsequential, you are too busy, or you have limited power to influence it the situation. Not taking action, however, may aggravate tensions and lead to an undesirable outcome.",

This may be appropriate when you have two strong parties with mutually exclusive objectives and when achieving these aims is not a top priority for the organization. Both sides will need to concede in these cases to come to a satisfactory resolution, which may only temporarily delay dealing with real conflict and issues.",

This helps to solve conflicts, while also building a foundational of trust for the future. This approach is ideal when you are dealing with issues that both parties consider too important to compromise on. It creates a win/win solution that incorporates ideas and perspectives from all sides. Reaching consensus can take time, so it is best to use this approach when a quick solution is not required.",

You are not afraid to take an aggressive approach and using your power and advantages to pursue your goals, even when it negatively impacts others. Winning in this way can be advantageous when you need to move quickly, as in a competitive situation or when the best interests of the organization are at stake, however a lack of give-and-take can strain your relationship with the other parties.",
