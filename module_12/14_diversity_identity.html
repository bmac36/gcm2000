                        <h2>What defines your identity?</h2>
                        <p>Regardless of the workplace, every worker has a different identity and story. Everyoneâ€™s backgrounds are diverse, meaning we have led different lives and had a variety of life experiences. We understand our own identity in the context of our life experiences, and we understand others in relation to our identity. How we perceive ourselves and others can affect how we interact with one another. Our identity shapes how we treat others and how others treat us, and gives each person a unique perspective.</p>
                        <p>As shown in the graphic below, our identity/perspective is shaped by many different factors including our place of birth, race, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic position, age, and physical ability (University of Oregon, 1999). Our perspective is also shaped by additional characteristics like our beliefs, values, interests, level of education, and cognitive ability. We may share some characteristics with others and still have different experiences. For example, two young men from the same village may share gender and ethnic characteristics, but could have very different identities if one is physically disabled or from a more privileged socio-economic position.</p>

                        <h2>The Concept of Diversity</h2>
                        <p>Each of us comes from a different background and collectively form a group of workers in the workplace that is diverse; however, diversity is a much more profound concept than this. </p>
                        <p>Diversity is interpreted and acted upon differently depending on the person and organization. Generally, it means appreciating and respecting the characteristics that make individuals unique and fostering an inclusive environment where all individuals feel supported to develop and contribute. Consider this definition of diversity developed to support a <a href="http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~asuomca/diversityinit.html" title="Summer Diversity Internships and Objectives" target="_blank">positive culture at the University of Oregon <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>:</p>

                        <h3>Definition of Diversity</h3>
                        	<p>The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect. It means understanding that each individual is unique,  and recognizing our individual differences.  These can be along  the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs,  political beliefs, or other ideologies. It is the exploration  of these differences in a safe, positive, and nurturing environment.  It is about understanding each other and moving beyond  simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the  rich dimensions of diversity contained within each individual.</p>
