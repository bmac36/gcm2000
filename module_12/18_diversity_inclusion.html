      			<p>Many employers in Canada see diversity as a good thing. All workplaces are diverse. Considering the wide scope of characteristics that make up each person’s identity, even workplaces that appear &quot;homogenous&quot; are generally diverse. However, some people from &quot;equity seeking groups&quot; (women, aboriginal people, racial and minorities, people with disabilities, and sexual minorities) have experienced social and historical persecution in Canada and have thus been traditionally underrepresented or given fewer opportunities for jobs, pay, or advancement in workplaces. While diversity involves a wide range of identities, enhancing workplace diversity is often associated with increasing the visibility and opportunity of workers from equity seeking groups.</p>
            <h2>Diversity and Inclusion Policies and Practices</h2>
            <p>Some employers have developed specific Diversity and Inclusion policies and practices to increase workforce diversity; these are often developed for recognizing and understanding the variety of identities in the workplace, and embracing and celebrating workforce differences. The goal is to increase respect for one another and have each person’s perspectives valued.
