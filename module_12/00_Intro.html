              <p class="mod_des">This week, we will explore how developing skills around working with others will contribute to your ability to thrive in the workplace. Working in teams has become standard in both classrooms and the workplace. Understanding how teams work, how to manage conflicts associated with teams, and how to deliver and receive feedback are essential to developing skills for working with others. Working with others also means working with people that have different perspectives from us; we will explore the concept of diversity and inclusion, and assess what biases we may hold around people who are different from ourselves. We will identify the reasons why diversity can actually lead to healthier organizations and more effective teams. Lastly, we will assess ethics as another dimension of working with others; as we may be working on teams with diverse perspectives, not everyone will hold the same values in terms of what is right and wrong. We will examine how personal codes of ethics may be different from professional or organizational codes, and how to reconcile these differences.</p>
