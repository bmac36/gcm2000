      <p>Individual personality types can have a big influence on how well a team is functioning. Depending on personality and preference, team members may have very different ideas around problem-solving, planning, distributing work, tracking progress, and communicating with one another. One member’s preferred method of communication, for example, may be a method that is ineffective for another team member. Consequently, many people have had negative experiences working on teams. Finding a way to decrease team conflict because of personality is key to building effective teams. </p>
      <p>Follow these four steps to develop teams that harness the power of personality types:</p>

                    <li>A leader role can help teams when they understand each team member’s differences and how they fit together, listens to others and understands the issues systemically, delegates work properly, and builds a shared vision towards completion.</li>
                    <li>A leader role can hurt teams when they get caught up in being in charge and become bossy or tyrannical. They may only listen to themselves or only value their own opinions, and creativity is stifled when expectations are unreasonable.</li>

                    <li>A creative thinker role can hurt teams when their impatience and impulsive thinking leads them to rush from idea to idea without committing to any one path, or considering the consequences before acting.</li>

                    <li>An analyst role can help teams plan their progress in detail by understanding each aspect of the task at hand, carefully researching the steps, and asking many questions about expectations. Typically cautious about adopting a new idea, they can prevent the team from making unnecessary mistakes.</li>
                    <li>An analyst role can hurt teams by holding up the team’s progress because of the many questions, excessive planning, and concern over taking risks.

                    <li>A pleaser role can help teams with conflict by helping everyone get along through their social approach to conflict resolution. Since pleasers support unity and cohesion, they can play a key role in  helping to keep the team together.</li>
                    <li>A pleaser role can hurt teams because they may not be forthcoming about opinions or feelings, leading to reduced morale or inefficiencies. Minimizing conflict isn’t always optimal, especially since ideas may need to be strenuously debated before being adopted</li>
