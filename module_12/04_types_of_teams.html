      	<p>Not all teams are the same. Different teams may be formed, maintained, or broken apart depending on what needs to be accomplished. Review the four common team types below to get a sense of typical teams and why they are formed.</p>
        <h3 class="secondary_text">Cross-Functional Teams</h3>
          <p>Members from different areas of expertise work to achieve a shared goal. On these teams, members may have different skills, interests and abilities, but they work together to develop a unique approach to the task based on their diverse perspectives. Each team member may have a different area of expertise, but may be required to work on tasks outside of their typical comfort zone.</p>
<h3 class="secondary_text">Self-Managed Teams</h3>
          <p>Self-managed teams are made up of members who work together on a shared goal but donâ€™t have any formal leadership or supervisor guiding them. Each member is accountable for their own performance. The team works on mutual respect and self-guidance, and work with one another to ensure tasks are complete.</p>
          <h3 class="secondary_text">Task Force</h3>
          <p>Task forces are formed for a special purpose, like a specific project or developing a solution to a critical issue. A task force tries to brainstorm all possible reasons that have caused an issue, and develop recommendations to resolve the issue quickly.</p>
          <h3 class="secondary_text">Process Improvement Teams</h3>
          <p>Process improvement teams focus on methods, operations, and procedures, and are formed with the specific goal of improving the particular component being studied.</p>
