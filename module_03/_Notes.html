                      <p>Arrange for Library Liaison to provide an orientation to Library resources and research guidance for students. This should have a focus on using business directories to look up employer information, since this correlates with the discussion for this week. </p>
                      <h3>From Juliet Conlon, LRC Business Liaison Dec 15:</h3>
                      <p>I recommend our <a href="http://exploreguides.conestogac.on.ca/c.php?g=241806" title="Company Research page" target="_blank">Company Research Guide <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> as a good starting point for company research. Reference Group Directory of Canadian Business is an example of a specific database that contains Canadian company reports that include categories such as location, industry profile, business demographics, management directory, business expenditures and competitors report. When researching details like company history and values I generally direct students to the company website.</p>

                        <p>Review the Scavenger Hunt with students:</p>
                        	<ul>
                          	<li>What they learned about the Library and using Library resources.</li>
                            <li>What outstanding questions about using the Library that they still have.</li>
                            <li>What interesting information they were able to uncover about potential occupations (e.g. essential skills NOC)</li>
                          </ul>
                        <p>Have students share how understanding how to properly research and reference will help them with their academic assignments, and in their professional and personal development. Remind students that the Occupational Scavenger Hunt should be posted to their blog and PART B will need to be submitted as part of their Personal Employment Strategy Portfolio.</p>

                        <p>Assign a company to each team to research and provide some materials for them to review. In addition to the resources provided, ask students to source some additional research on employers. (An employer research template will be provided for students to fill in.) They will need to collectively prepare a brief report indicating what practices make these employers examples of great companies to work for and present this to the class. Students must post the report to the Group Discussion Forum for the week and will need to include proper references and in-text citations, to be checked by the instructor during the class.</p>
                        <p>Distribute Employer Scavenger Hunt and ask students to complete this activity independently.</p>

                        <p>Once they have completed the in-class research assignment, students should discuss their answers in their teams. After class, students will post their answers in in their Group Discussion Forum. They must also post a reply to each team member’s postings to promote robust discussion.
