      	<p>Employment standards represent the minimum standards established by law that define and guarantee rights in the workplace. You have the right to safe work and fair treatment. Being informed of your specific rights can help you stand up for yourself in your job.</p>
        <p>However, you also have obligations to follow the law, comply with company policy, and abide by standards of practice. If you signed a contract as part of your job offer, both you and your employer are responsible for following the terms of the contract. You could face discipline or termination for failing to comply with the law, policy, or standards. </p>
        <p>If you feel that your rights are being violated:</p>
        	<ul>
          	<li>Try having a talk with your Human Resources department or union representative. </li>
            <li>Should expert advice be needed, you should contact an employment lawyer.</li>
            <li>If you are under 25 you may wish to seek information specific to <a href="http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/atwork/youngworkers.php" title="Young Workers" target="_blank">young workers in Ontario <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</li>
         </ul>
       <h2>Rights and Obligations of Foreign Workers</h2>
       <p>If you are a foreign worker, itâ€™s important to remember that Canadian employment law protects all workers, including you! Your employer must pay you for your work, must make sure that your workplace is safe, and cannot take your passport or work permit away from you. See the following for more information on the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/tfw-rights.asp" title="Understand Your Rights - foreign workers" target="_blank">rights and obligations of foreign workers <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
