      <p>Do you know your rights as an employee in Canada? Workplace laws have changed drastically since the 1800s, when being a member of a union was a crime. Nowadays many employees donâ€™t know what their workplace rights and obligations are. Being informed can help you make good career and work decisions, and aware of your rights as a worker in Canada. </p>

          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check secondary_text"></i>Employment standards in Canada are enforced provincial Employment Standards Acts, legislation that sets the minimum standards that employers and employees must follow. </li>
          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check secondary_text"></i>These Acts differ slightly in each province, so see the <a href="http://hrcouncil.ca/hr-toolkit/policies-employment-legislation.cfm" title="Employment Legislation and Standards" target="_blank">HR Policies &amp; Employment Legislation site <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for information relevant to the province or territory in which you think you will be working.</li>

                  <p>Each province and territory sets their own minimum wage, and differences exist between the different regions. Visit the <a href="http://srv116.services.gc.ca/dimt-wid/sm-mw/menu.aspx?lang=eng" title="Minimum Wage Database" target="_blank">Minimum Wage Database <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> to find the minimum wage in the different provinces and territories and see the <a href="http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/tools/esworkbook/deductions.php" title="link to Ministry of Labour website" target="_blank">Ministry of Labour website <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for more information.</p>
                  <p>With very limited exceptions, basic rules govern all employees in each province. For example, in Ontario, all employees are entitled to receive a minimum wage for time on the job, receive a vacation entitlement, work no more than 48 hours in one week, receive 8 hours of rest in between shifts, and receive standard meal breaks. Except for very limited circumstances (e.g., as part of schooling), unpaid working arrangements for workers are not legal.</p>
                  <p>For specifics about your entitlements (e.g., vacation, leaves, overtime, layoff or termination right), see the <a href="https://www.gtha.com/Portals/0/PDFs/Leg Updates/Employment Standards Act Guide.pdf" title="link to Employment Standards Act Guide PDF" target="_blank">Employment Standards Act Guide <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a>.</p>

                  <p>Employment equity involves achieving equality in all aspects of employment, including equal pay for different work of equal value (e.g., Pay Equity), and employment equality, which represents proactive employment practices for four designated groups: women, Aboriginal people, people with disabilities, and visible minorities. Workplace equality also includes accessibility standards for people with disabilities. Employers use impartial systems of recruitment, job evaluation, and accessibility standards to ensure employment conditions are equal among candidates and employees.
