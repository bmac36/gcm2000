                      <p>Any Canadian workplace has many customs that govern the behaviors of workers. Unlike organizational culture, where organizations have different values which are reflected in different organizational practices, workplace customs are generally universal to a culture. These customs are often unspoken rules that everyone generally follows, and violating these rules could lead to friction with co-workers, others having a negative view of your work, or fewer opportunities to be promoted. </p>
                      <p>Being aware of these customs is critically important if you are from another culture, as you need to know how to integrate into the Canadian workplace. Also, this knowledge is important if you are working in a multicultural environment with people from different backgrounds, regardless of your own background. </p>

                      <p>In Canada, work styles and pace differ between workplaces. Most Canadian work environments are very relaxed in terms of dress and level of formality, although shorts and jeans are not that common in office environments. Women tend not to wear very revealing or tight-fitting clothing, although this depends on the individual and on the workplace/sector. </p>
                      <p>Workplaces often have a little flexibility about what exact hours you work, and what time you need to arrive. These arrangements are generally set ahead of time. Employees usually focus on their work attentively throughout the day. Spending long periods of time chatting with other employees, surfing the web, excessive texting, or other personal activity is seen as unacceptable and is referred to as “time-theft” (because you are &quot;stealing&quot; paid time for personal activities). Completing your projects on time, serving clients effectively, and paying careful attention to management instructions are considered high priorities. Working hours beyond your established shift is often expected, especially for managers. Arriving late is seen negatively, although arriving five to ten minutes late with a good reason may be excused if it only happens occasionally.</p>
