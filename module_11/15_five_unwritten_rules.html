	<p>In most organizations, &quot;Management&quot; are people in formal leadership positions. These people often share common titles (e.g., Supervisor, Manager, Director, Associate, Foreman, Team Lead). These positions often have core responsibilities regarding hiring and firing employees, staff discipline, scheduling and assigning teams/work, and developing corporate strategy. Management are expected to be leaders that lead from example, and have some degree of technical competence in their role. Some management have job duties shared with staff, while others’ roles are strictly to manage people. </p>
  <p>All managers are expected to make decisions and manage people using skills like charisma, diplomacy, and tact. Common people management practices include things like regular staff meetings, individual coaching, teaching/training, demonstrations, and Q&amp;A sessions. Staff may communicate opinions that challenge management’s decisions and this is often welcomed; however, being excessively direct and assertive can also be seen as “insubordinate,” meaning you are unwilling to submit to the authority of the leader and are a challenging employee to manage. </p>
  <p>Managers also handle conflict constructively and prevent personal or resource issues from disrupting the effectiveness of the office. Managers are also expected to make decisions and enforce rules to meet deadlines and ensure others are completing work.</p>

	<p>Workers are expected to:</p>
  		<ul>
      	<li>Abide by all laws, policies and procedures, follow the direction of managers, and be agreeable with colleagues.</li>
        <li>Be punctual, engaged, and a friendly worker who is productive and effective</li>
        <li>Show confidence as well as humility and good listening skills. Canadians tend to appreciate approachability and problem-solving abilities over authoritarian styles of management; however, a person who comes across as ’knowing it all’ may be seen as not collaborative or even arrogant and inflexible. </li>

    <p>A good work environment is closely linked to <a href="../module_10/08_organizational_culture.html" title="link to Week 10: Organizational Culture topic">Organizational Culture</a>, and expectations may be slightly different depending on the industry. Yet common standards exist in terms of what a good work environment looks like, including: </p>
    	<ul>
      	<li>A courteous, cordial, and friendly atmosphere, where workers greet one another with “good morning” and “good evening” when arriving to or leaving from the workplace. </li>
        <li>Well-groomed employees with appropriately-professional dress, hair, and personal grooming. Employees are expected to launder clothing regularly, use deodorant, and bathe frequently.</li>
        <li>Employees and management generally expect happy, engaged, and productive workers with clean workspaces, with no garbage at each desk or workspace. Disorganized or cluttered workspaces may be tolerated or even seen as a positive sign of a productive worker, but this depends on the organization.</li>
        <li>No &quot;gossip&quot; or negative speculation, such as speaking poorly of other workers or the employer.</li>

	<p>Some jobs may require general duties that are shared among many workers, or duties that are other than what’s listed in the job posting or position description. This may include client interaction, coverage, general cleaning duties, or other. Taking &quot;initiative&quot; or helping others after your task is complete is considered a requirement more than an option, and you will be expected to be flexible. Your job may also change over time, and management are legally allowed to change your job or duties at any time, provided those changes do not change more than 80 percent of the original job (in which case it could be considered a case of constructive dismissal).  </p>
