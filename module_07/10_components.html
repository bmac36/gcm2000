      <p>Before you customize your existing r&eacute;sum&eacute for the job posting you have been given for the week, let’s review the various components that are present in a typical résumé. Does your résumé have these elements? Take some time to update your résumé after reviewing each to ensure that you have all the information you need before writing to the job posting.</p>
      <p><strong>Click on each component to learn more.</strong> There are a variety of ways to organize these components, <a href=" http://mashable.com/2015/08/11/organize-resume/#5gCAOEf0Yiqs" title="Four Better Ways to lay out your Resume depending on where you are in your career" target="_blank">depending on where you are in your career <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.

Organize your employment in <strong>reverse chronological format</strong>, that is from <span class="lead">Present</span> to <span class="lead">Past</span>.</p>
                  <p>When you describe your previous employment, focus on your <span class="lead">accomplishments</span>, not your duties. Companies are in business to make a profit: what value do you bring as an employee? Emphasize how your presence in the previous organization brought change or made an impact.</p>
                  <p>When writing your work experience section, consider the following questions. See <a href="12_writing_accomplishment_Statements.html" title="Topic: Writing Accomplishment Statments">Writing Accomplishment Statements</a> for more detail on how to write strong accomplishment statements.</p>

                  <p>It is well worth becoming a student member (usually at a discounted rate) of the professional association(s) relevant to your field.
