      <p>The cover letter introduces you to a potential employer. Take this opportunity to express your interest (why do you want this job?) and to convey how your experience and skills will be of value to the company. This letter can determine whether or not you will be called in for an interview.</p>
      <p>Before you write the letter, scan the job posting for two things: key responsibilities of the position and the essential minimum qualifications the employer is looking for. Match their requirements to your experience, skills and education.</p>
      <p>If no job posting exists and you would like to apply to a company that has not listed a job opportunity, go directly to the employer’s website and conduct some research into the company culture and their key products, clients, services, etc. and connect your experience, skills and education to these points.</p>
      <p>The cover letter is a business letter, so it follows business letter format. Expand each section below to learn more about the various components of the cover letter. The next topic is a sample of a cover letter.</p>

                      <h3></h3>
                      <p>Put your name and mailing address at the top. Ideally, you will put this in the header of the word processing document and you will use the same format for the cover letter, your résumé and your word-processed thank you note.</p>
                      <p>Next comes the current date: Month day, year. For example, October 21, 2014.</p>
                      <p>The employer’s name, title and mailing address follow. If the name is not in the job posting, it is worth the time to make a brief phone call to ask for the name of the person you are applying to. It shows an extra level of interest in the position. If you cannot obtain the name, you can address your cover letter to “Hiring Manager”.</p>
                      <p>A subject line often comes between the recipient’s mailing address and the greeting. This is where you would put the title of the position you are applying to and the competition number.</p>
                      <p>Greet the recipient with his or her title (Mr., Ms. or Dr.) and last name. Be sure you have the recipient’s gender and the spelling of the last name correct. Call to make sure it is right.</p>
                      <p>See <a href="18_cover_letter_sample.html">the sample</a> in the next topic for formatting.</p>

                      <h3></h3>
                        <p>This paragraph should convey interest in the position, and how you found out about the position. It should very clearly state the job opportunity you are applying for. Make it easy for the employer to figure out what you are applying for. Job applicants that are “applying for any opportunity” show a lack of focus and this is frustrating for recruiters.</p>
                        <p>There are a wide variety of ways to start the paragraph, so try to make it interesting. Take the opportunity to offer, very briefly, your top few qualifications.</p>

                      <h3></h3>
                        <p>The middle paragraphs should convey your interest in the position and a clear connection between the posting and your technical skills, work/volunteer experience, and transferable skills. Focus on your most relevant and related skills, experience (work, volunteer), academic credentials that show your interest and commitment to the employer.</p>
                        <p>Use key words here that are echoed from the job posting. Some employers sort letters and résumés digitally and use a key word search. Put the most relevant and related information at the top of the letter.</p>
