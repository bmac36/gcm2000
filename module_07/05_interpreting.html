      		<p>The job posting represents the company&rsquo;s 30-second elevator pitch to encourage potential employees to help the company meet its business goals.</p>
          <p>Every job posting will be a little different, but you should watch for the following elements. <strong>Click on each title to learn how you can use this information to construct a job application package that employers want to read.</strong></p>

<h3></h3>
<p>You will find the job title at the top of the posting. Use this title in all your application materials because it shows that you have read the job posting carefully and have made a conscious choice to apply to this job rather than send out a standardized résumé and cover letter.</p>
<p>If there is a job posting number, be sure to include this information as well. A company may be running many job searches at the same time. Providing the number will make it easier to send your application to the right people.</p>

     <li>Minimum amount of experience</li>
     <li>Specific duties and responsibilities</li>
  </ul>
<p>The amount of experience can be tricky to interpret when you are first applying to jobs. Two or three years of experience is an entry-level position; five years of experience means that the employer is looking for someone who has started to move through the ranks of a company.</p>
<p>Some postings are extensive and represent the full wish list of the employer for a new employee. If you cannot meet every listed requirement, aim to meet at least 75% of the requirements in the posting.</p>

<h3></h3>
 <p>Skills and abilities refer to the technical skills that may be needed to perform the job competently or the transferable skills that will make the candidate successful in the position. Technical skills reflect the standards of the industry and the company. Transferable skills such as &quot;results oriented&quot; or &quot;team player&quot; appear frequently in a variety of job postings. This reading from AOL Jobs explains <a href="http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2012/03/15/8-job-posting-buzzwords-explained/" title="Eight Job Posting Buzzwords Explained" target="_blank">eight common transferable skills and how to address each term in your application <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
 <p>Pay attention to how the job posting describes the skills and abilities. If you use the same keywords in your application, you will demonstrate that you have read the posting carefully and thought about how your experience meets the company’s needs. </p>

<p>The job posting will explain how you should submit your application. Follow the directions as stated. If you fail to follow these directions, your application will probably be screened out before the hiring manager sees it.</p>
