            <p><strong>My Reflection: Build your professional network off campus </strong></p>
            <p>1.	On July 26th, I signed up for the meetup &quot;Hackernest KW August Tech Social&quot; on Meetup.com. This event was to take place on August 14th at 8 p.m. in Uptown Waterloo at the Communitech Data Hub. I RSVP’d to attend this event and sent a comment to the event board that I was&quot;“looking forward to attending and seeing the new Data Hub space&quot;. </p>
            <p>On the day of the Meetup, which was Monday August 14th, I took the bus to Uptown Waterloo and arranged to arrive right at 8 p.m., when the event started. I paid a $10 voluntary donation at the door and circulated throughout the room, speaking with six different attendees. I managed to deliver my elevator pitch three different times and handed my calling card to two strong contacts &mdash; A.J. from TechFlite and Della from Entrenous Inc. &mdash; who mentioned they may have a part-time job opportunity for me. At 9 p.m., the meetup organizer, Amaris, gave a presentation about the new Data Hub space and I learned about some new big data initiatives in the Region of Waterloo &ndash; some really cool stuff!</p>
            <p>2.	The Essential Employability Skills I developed as a result of attending the event were speaking, listening, gathering and managing information, and networking. Before the event, I had to gather and manage information by looking up and recording the details of the event, reviewing each person who had RSVP’d to see if they were a first-degree connection, and tracking which employers were sponsoring the event. I also had to produce written notes immediately after the event so that I would not forget the conversations I had with others. When at the event, I had to develop speaking and listening skills when interacting with others, and networking skills to identify common areas of interest and develop professional relationships with others. </p>
            <p>3.	Attending the Hackernest KW August Tech Social helps me as a job seeker in terms of gathering information. I was able to learn more about different local employers, which projects are upcoming, which skills are in-demand, and even what a local tech space looks like. But even more important was the network I started to develop. After attending the event, I got six new LinkedIn connections and now hope to see the same people at the next event. I also have two job leads which may turn into a part-time job opportunity. I am really surprised and excited by how much this simple effort enhanced my employability. </p>
