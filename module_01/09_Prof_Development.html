                  <p>Making weekly reflective posts to your own personal blog is one of the ways you will get to work at maintaining a good digital brand in this course. It will also help you to manage your personal and professional development on an ongoing basis. As you will learn, development activities such as reflective blogging will form a critical part of your career success.</p>

<p><strong>Why are development activities so critical? </strong></p>
<p>Up to this point in your academic career, you have likely engaged in a fair amount of training but may be new to the concept of intentional development. Training and development are often used interchangeably, but there is an important distinction between the two. </p>

                        <p>Conventional teaching and training tends to be more formal and linear. It comes from outside out of an individual. Its focus is on the transfer of pre-determined knowledge and skills to meet a specific external purpose (set by a college or employer, etc.), such as programming a computer. </p>

        <p>When it comes to work and society, most problems stem from people feeling unhappy or being unfulfilled (Chapman, 2013). Conventional training does little to counter these effects but individual growth through development activities, such as reflective blogging, helps people to learn and develop in their own direction and in their own way. It addresses personal feelings of confidence, fulfilment, and sense of purpose that are needed to truly be successful in the workplace. </p>
