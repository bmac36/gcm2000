			"question" : "<strong>Curtis:</strong> This individual consumes large amounts of a substance, may demonstrate antisocial (or inappropriate) attitudes and receive criticisms from others about this behaviour (often with a promise from the individual to change).  Difficulties with this behaviour include: the consumption dulls the feelings that motivate using, but does not allow the individual to acquire new coping skills for changing their behaviour (ex. the idea of hitting a punching bag with youth to take out anger works short-term but does not help long-term). In this situation the individual who experiences negative consequences, may slow their consumption if they recognize the criticism, but likely do not stop using entirely.",

			"question" : "<strong>Meg:</strong> This individual does not feel “normal” unless they have some drug (or substance) in their system. Consumption interferes with many aspects of a productive lifestyle (i.e. work, home, family responsibilities). If others give criticisms, these are ignored or denied (i.e. “I do not have a drinking problem” or, “I do not have a gambling problem”).  This individual often makes frequent promises to cut down or stop, but rarely follows through with this for any significant time period. ",
