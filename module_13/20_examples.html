								<p class="stat-reveal bubble-med pull-right"><span class="lead">Helping my professional association.</span><br />&quot;I volunteer to help out with event registration for my professional association’s monthly meetings. I knew they were always looking for people to help out because they would call for volunteers in their newsletter. Since I have a very busy schedule, volunteering only once per month was a good way to get involved while keeping my schedule manageable. Being an usher means I get to stand at the front door and show people to their tables; this puts me in a position to meet many new people and be recognized by important people who may be hiring in my field. After only a few months, everybody knows my name and recognizes me as an important member of the association.&quot;</p>

                  <p class="stat-reveal bubble-med pull-right"><span class="lead">Giving tech support to my local cultural organization.</span><br />&quot;I volunteer to maintain the website for my local cultural organization. I have some technical skills, and I noticed that my cultural organization didn’t have any webpage. I approached the leader and asked if I could volunteer to develop a web presence – they thought it was a great idea. I always include this volunteer position on my resume to demonstrate my experience applying technical skills.&quot;</p>

								<p class="stat-reveal bubble-med pull-right"><span class="lead">Volunteering as a youth mentor.</span><br />&quot;I volunteer as a youth mentor. I heard about this opportunity at a networking event, where I work with local youth that need extra help with their studies. I’m a really social person, and I like helping people because it makes me feel good. Volunteering as a mentor means that I get to make a real difference in kids’ lives by acting as a role model. Since I have been so active and made such a positive difference, the leader of the organization has nominated me for an award, which will look great in a cover letter!&quot;</p>

								<p class="stat-reveal bubble-med pull-right"><span class="lead">Managing a soccer team.</span><br />&quot;I volunteer as a team manager for a soccer team in the intermural league at the college. I heard about this opportunity from a posting on a bulletin board on campus. Volunteering as a team manager was a natural fit since I am a competitive person who is passionate about sports. I also get the opportunity to develop my leadership, organizational, and conflict management skills when dealing with team members. Our team is going to the league championship this season, so I now have a terrific accomplishment for me to use as an example during a behavioural question at a job interview.&quot;</p>
