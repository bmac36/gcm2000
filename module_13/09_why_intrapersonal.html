      		<h2>Intrapersonal skills are… </h2>
          <h3 class="secondary_text">the talents and abilities that reside within ourselves and allow us to achieve our goals. </h3>
          <p>Sometimes these are called perceptive and reflective skills.</p>
          <h2>Overcoming Challenges to Reach Goals</h2>
          <p>We naturally face many obstacles when pursuing our goals.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          	<ul>
            	<li>We may have impulses that run contrary to our goal.<br />
              		<em class="secondary_text">Eating potato chips instead of going to the gym if our goal is to get fit. </em></li>
              <li>We also come across situational obstacles that get in the way of us achieving our goal.<br />
              <em class="secondary_text">Our goal is to be hired by a specific employer, but the employer undertakes a hiring freeze. </em></li>
              <li>We may have two or more goals that compete, so that achieving one goal actually diminishes our ability to achieve the other.<br />
              <em class="secondary_text">If our goals are to travel the world and have a robust savings account, we may achieve one goal at the expense of the other.</em></li>
           </ul>
           <div class="callout">

            	<img src="../images/mentors/jenn.jpg" class="img-circle circle-med dot-brdr primary-brdr pull-right" alt="Mentor Jenn" />
              <p>Intrapersonal skills help us to deal with these conflicts, stay motivated, and continue to pursue our goals. Hence, we use these skills when we are thinking about things in retrospect, interpreting events, understanding others’ messages, and responding to external actions, events, and behaviours. You will review some of the core intrapersonal skills in the next topic.</p>

				<h2>Benefits of Good Intrapersonal Skills</h2>
        	<p>Intrapersonal skills enable us to achieve our goals by helping us to identify obstacles or barriers and respond to them. They also help us process information, interpret, and apply our learning in new contexts. These skills are foundational for interpersonal skills as well, as we need to be in control of our communication with ourselves before we communicate with others.</p>

          <div class="clearfix"></div>
          <p>Think back to the last challenge you faced and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
          	<ol class="custom-counter">
            	<li>What was the nature of the self-talk that directed your approach to the challenge?</li>
              <li>Did it help make things better or worse? Why?</li>
              <li>What did you learn about yourself in the process of working through the issue?</li>
           </ol>
