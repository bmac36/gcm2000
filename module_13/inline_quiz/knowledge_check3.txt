Fortunately for me, my more experienced coworkers frequently came to my aid to teach me the systems. They also offered me suggestions on how I could do my job more efficiently. No one told my more-seasoned colleagues to help me out. They clearly considered me as part of the team from the beginning, and by helping me, they were helping everyone on the team, and ultimately, they were helping the organization have the highest degree of productivity.&quot;<br /><br />Which <b>empathy</b> skill did Anwar’s team demonstrate in this circumstance?

      "questionText":"<b>Mentor Case #2: Charizar &mdash; Taking steps to improve her division’s image.</b><br />Consider Charizar’s experience:<br /><br />&quot;I remember being promoted to a mid-level position in a brand new division in my organization. I had some ideas about how to improve the division’s image with our customers (which was pretty bad at the time). On my first attempt to explain my ideas at a staff meeting, I had difficulty speaking properly and kept stumbling over my words. Everyone in the meeting was confused with what I was trying to say. I didn’t want to give up on my good ideas and asked my supervisor for a second chance. Before my second attempt, I wrote everything out on a script. I also drew a diagram to help everyone follow my thinking visually. I practiced what I would say. This second attempt went much better. After I got through my speech, there was much discussion. People understood my concerns and suggestions, and my boss was so impressed with how well I communicated my ideas that they put me in charge of developing a new set of policies to retain our customers.&quot;<br /><br />Which social skill did Charizar develop in order to sell her good ideas to her team?",
