Every quarter, my productivity numbers would demonstrate that I was the top achiever in my division. However, I didn’t realize that there was a problem with how I got those results. My approach to getting the work done was to push others hard and be impatient with any delays. I had a tendency to get angry with colleagues who were holding things up. What’s worse, I didn’t know that I was doing this. When my supervisor shared some feedback that I was &lsquo;leaving a trail of destruction&rsquo;, I was truly surprised.&quot;<br /><br />Which intrapersonal skill did Naweed need in order to change his behaviour?",

      "questionText":"<b>Mentor Case #2: Jenn &mdash; Dealing with frustrations while driving.</b><br />Consider Jenn’s experience:<br /><br />&quot;I used to feel a lot of frustration whenever I encountered people driving slowly on the highway. I would encounter a slow driver and become overwhelmed by frustration; I would honk my horn, drive aggressively around them, and even shout out my window. Once I learned more about intrapersonal skills, I learned to develop my metacognitive skills. I became aware of my way of thinking about thinking, and started to react differently to the experience of frustration. I would first experience frustration as an emotion and before acting, would internally say to myself, ‘I am feeling frustrated.' This split-second of awareness was just enough time to stop me from doing anything negative.&quot;<br /><br />Which intrapersonal skill did Jenn need to develop in order to change her behaviour?",
