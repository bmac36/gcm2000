              <p>Collect information by focusing on a specific trend, field, or industry of interest. Look at a large number of resources. Consult with a number of different types of sources (like newspapers, reports, people), and be creative in tracking down the information.</p>

              <p class="lead">Organize It</p>
              <p>Organize your information by noting references and keeping a list or compiling a document of your findings. You must think carefully about where information is coming from. Official sources of information, like the government, a college or university, or a professional organization will have information that is probably more reliable than the opinions of one person. If you find the same information repeated in multiple sources, it’s more likely to be true.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: none; color: #333;">To come up with a career strategy based on labour market information, start analyzing the information you have collected from the various sources on one cluster of careers, industry, or sector. 
Think actively about what the information is telling you. Form hypotheses about your sector and test these hypotheses to draw conclusions. Look for patterns in what each source is telling you.

              <p>Share your findings with your network of family, friends, co-workers, classmates, instructors, and contacts. Refer to your research notes before meeting potential employers, attending networking events, or an interview. Also use your research to evaluate employment opportunities.</p>
