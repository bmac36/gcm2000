                  <p>In spite of early government intervention in the economy via tariffs, the economy fluctuated wildly between periods of boom and bust. Resource exports of grain, timber, and minerals were dependent on global demand, and markets in Canada would deflate when global demand decreased. Canada experienced severe economic depressions in the 1890s, 1910s, and the famous “Great Depression” from 1929 to 1939 (which is mentioned in the podcast). During this period, manufacturing output dropped, many companies went bankrupt, and a significant proportion of the workforce lost their jobs. When the global economic downturn in 2008 occurred, the event was called the “Great Recession” in reference to what had happened in the 1930s.</p>

                 <p>In many industries, such as automotive and telecommunications, mergers and acquisitions led to the rise of monopolies and oligopolies. Industry became concentrated in very large factory complexes who mass-produced goods with the assistance of sophisticated machines for Canadian and primarily American markets. Some firms diversified their operations as they grew, and others switched their focus towards different industries (like from the podcast, what the piano company <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/arts/music/notes-of-sorrow-in-changes-at-steinway.html?_r=2" title="article: Notes of sorrow in changes at Steinway" target="_blank">Steinway did when they started to build coffins  <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>).</p></button>

                 <p>After the Second World War, Canada entered a period of explosive economic growth, low unemployment, and rising standards of living. Post-secondary education became accessible to the majority of Canadians, and these sectors grew enormously (including the founding of Conestoga College in 1967!). 
However, the “postwar boom”, the period between 1950 and 1975, was not to last. Competition from overseas manufacturers, and the declining demand for domestic products, coupled with disruptions in the energy sector led to a decline in traditional manufacturing. Canadian free trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement opened up trade in North America and beyond by finally removing protective tariffs, but caused a further decline in manufacturing and competition for resource export.</p></button>
