      <p>A student recently came to Anwar looking for advice. He was getting frustrated in his job hunt. As a top student, he assumed finding a job would be easy. He’s been monitoring job posting websites multiple times per week and has applied for more than 50 jobs online. He’s been waiting for a response but so far nothing has happened. His final academic semester is wrapping up and he hasn’t yet received a call for a single interview.</p>
      <p>Anwar advised the student to make networking the main focus of his job search strategy. The student is interested in giving it a try but has some serious questions about how to proceed. How can Anwar help him to overcome his challenges?</p>
      <h3 class="secondary_text">&quot;Do i even have a network?&quot;</h3>
      <p>The student was a bit intimidated by the idea of using his network to get a job. He wasn’t sure that he even had a network in place. His work experience is limited and he has a small circle of friends.</p><p>What can Anwar suggest to help the student identify his network? Explore the options below.</p>
      <h4>Option 1</h4>
      <p><strong>Compile a list of all the people you know well from your personal life.  </strong></p>
      <p>Listing the people from his personal life, including friends, family and people he regularly socializes with in the community (e.g. teammates or neighbours) can help the student to see that he truly does have a network in place.</p>
      <h4>Option 2</h4>
      <p><strong>List schoolmates who might be valuable contacts. </strong></p>
      <p>This is a great idea! The student’s cohort of classmates provides him with an instant network. Common interests and educational backgrounds also make this group more receptive to helping him.</p>
      <h3 class="secondary_text">&quot;How do I find &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; jobs?&quot;</h3>
      <p>The student recognizes that a lot of good jobs simply aren’t posted online, but he isn’t sure how to leverage his network to find them.</p>
      <p>What can Anwar suggest to help the student uncover hidden jobs? Explore the options below. </p>
      <h4>Option 1</h4>
      <p><strong>Let your contacts know what type of job you are looking for.  </strong></p>
      <p>Letting everyone in his network know what he can do and what he is looking for certainly gets the word out. Even if his contacts have no immediate leads, creating this awareness puts them in a better position to act on his behalf if a potential opportunity arises. </p>
      <h4>Option 2</h4>
      <p><strong>Consider every person you meet as a potential job source.</strong></p>
      <p>Great advice! It would be good if the student was mindful of the potential opportunities that every person he meets might be able to offer so he can take action. A casual conversation at the grocery store, a family party, or at a sporting event could generate a job lead.</p>
      <h3 class="secondary_text">&quot;How can I stand out from the crowd?&quot;</h3>
      <p>The student thought his skills and education would give him an edge in the job market but he seriously underestimated the caliber of the competition. Many jobs require multiple years of experience, which as a student he just doesn’t have. </p>
      <p>What can Anwar suggest to help the student to stand apart? Explore the various options below. </p>
      <h4>Option 1</h4>
      <p><strong>Volunteer with a professional association.</strong></p>
      <p>Being active in an association (e.g. working on a committee) can give the student an opportunity to demonstrate his skills and develop meaningful contacts with other association members, some of whom may be in a position to hire him. </p>
      <h4>Option 2</h4>
      <p><strong>Work towards face-to-face or telephone contact.</strong></p>
      <p>People connect with people, so moving towards more face-to-face or telephone contact can help the student to make a good impression on people of influence in his network. </p>
      <h3 class="secondary_text">Summary</h3>
      <p>Networking may take a bit of extra time and effort but it connects you to people who can provide you with information, advice, and referrals. It’s a proactive way of moving closer to your career goals. </p>
      <p>As you approach your own job search, think of the networking strategies that you might apply to increase your chances of winning a career-related job.</p>
