                  <br/>
                  Dear Mr. Smith:<br/>
                  <br/>
                  I am a second-year student in the Management Studies Program at Conestoga College, and spoke with you at the P4E Career Fair in February.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  Before starting my career, I am very interested in learning all I can about typical career paths in the management field and what skills I might need to develop during my final year of study at Conestoga. I would greatly appreciate 15 to 20 minutes of your time to ask you a few questions about your position as a Management Specialist with ABC Corporation, as well as other opportunities in the field.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  Thank you for your consideration. I will contact you next week to arrange a convenient time to meet with you.<br/>
                  <br/>
                  Sincerely,<br/>

                    <li>Respect their time. Keep the appointment length within the time that you requested and don’t take much longer or shorter.</li>

                  <p>Dear Mr. Smith:</p>
                  <p>I appreciate your meeting with me yesterday to talk about the work that you do as the Management Specialist. I now have a much better understanding of the field, particularly within a large organization like ABC Corporation.</p>
                  <p>It was helpful to hear that an entry-level position often requires some experience with budget management. I have decided to take on those responsibilities for the executive council of my student association as a treasurer. I have also called your colleague, Ms. Jones, at XZY Incorporated to make an appointment to talk with her.</p>
                  <p>It was very helpful to have had the opportunity to talk with you. Thank you again for your time and advice.</p>
                  <p>Sincerely,</p>
                  <p><em>Robert Robertson</em></p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Keep in touch with the person, especially if you had an effective interaction. If you connected over your program, perhaps let them know when you graduate. If you follow up with somebody else, let them know that you followed up on their advice and how things are going as a result. This relationship could become an important part of your network.</p>
