             <p class="text-uppercase text-right"><a id="hideTip"><strong>Close</strong></a></p>
            	<p>When we think of the job market, we often think of advertised positions on job boards such as <a href="http://www.indeed.ca" title="Indeed.ca" target="_blank">Indeed.ca <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. Job seekers search these sites for jobs and submit their cover letters and resumes through email or an automated service in an attempt to get an interview. </p>
              <p>This approach represents &quot;satisficing&quot; or putting a lot of effort into something that is easy but has a low rate of return. The zero return rate is not surprising if you consider the disadvantages of applying for jobs via the advertised market:</p>
              	<ul>
                	<li>Online postings are often bombarded by hundreds of applicants, many of whom have many years of experience and advanced credentials.</li>
                  <li>This market often over represents lowly paid/unskilled or highly paid/highly skilled positons (while most people find positions between these two extremes).</li>
                  <li>Many advertised jobs don’t exist or are already filled when the jobs are advertised.</li>
                  <li>The required qualifications listed can be significantly greater or lower than what is actually required for the job.</li>
               </ul>

        <h2>Hidden Job Market...</h2>
        <h3>Roughly 80% of job openings</h3>
              <p class=" text-uppercase text-right"><a id="hideHidden"><strong>Close</strong></a></p>
        		<p>The good news is that there is another option -- the hidden job market. The career coaches Duncan Mathison and Martha Finney describe the hidden job market as a &quot;secret parallel universe of opportunities that are waiting for anyone with the skill, curiosity, and energy to seek them out&quot; (2010). Approximately 80% of all jobs are never published in newspapers, on company websites, or on job boards. </p>
            <p>Gaining access to the hidden market through networking is notably different from just applying to dozens of random jobs as they become available online. Consider some of the advantages of gaining access to this secret universe:</p>
            		<ul>
                	<li>You gain a competitive advantage over those hundreds and thousands of others competing for the public postings. </li>
                  <li>After you find the employer, occupation, or field that’s right for you, you can actually influence the development of a job. </li>
                  <li>Employers prefer to hire a “known quantity”, someone who has been recommended by someone they know and trust.</li>
                  <li>You are likely to be more satisfied with your work and earn a higher income in jobs you source through the hidden job market.</li>
               </ul>
