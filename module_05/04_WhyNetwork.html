      <h2>Increasing Your Chances of Success</h2>
      <p>The student’s job search frustrations are pretty common. Many job hunters tend to apply to online postings and then wait to be contacted for a job interview. While messages confirming your applications have been received can feel like progress, don’t be fooled. This passive strategy rarely pays off. Career management guru Steve Dalton calls it “satisficing”, meaning you are selecting the first available solution to your need, rather than optimizing your solution (Dalton, 2 Hour Job Search, 4).</p>
      <p>If this is your only job search activity, your odds of successfully obtaining a job are lower than if you took a couple of approaches at once. What if you could find out about job opportunities before they were posted, or skip right to an interview without officially applying for a job? This is where networking and accessing the hidden job market comes in. Networking is a much more active job search strategy. It is the act of making connections and building relationships with other people to share information, ideas, resources, and job opportunities.</p>

      <p>Engaging in networking activities allows you to gain a network of contacts, each connected to other people. According to current research, <a href="http://www.careercast.com/career-news/underestimated-importance-personal-networking" target="_blank">the average person knows approximately 634 people</a>, and any one of these individuals may be able to refer you to someone who is hiring in your field.</p>
