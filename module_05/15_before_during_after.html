                        <p>Consider the following advice from <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/9-tips-for-navigating-your-first-networking-event" title="9 Tips for naviagating your first networking event" target="_blank">The Muse <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>:</p>
                        <h3>Make an Effective Introduction and Impression.</h3>
                        <p>When you meet someone new, introduce yourself by making eye contact, smiling, stating your first and last name, and giving a firm but brief handshake. If you have a long name, consider using a short version, or saying what your name rhymes with. Then listen for the other person’s name and use it at least two times while you’re speaking. This will not only help you remember the name, but also make you appear sincere and interested in the conversation. </p>
                        <h3>Listen First, Then <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carrie-wilkens-phd/how-to-talk-so-people-wil_b_5269882.html" title="How to Talk so People will Listen" target="_blank">Speak <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></h3>
                        <p>Say hello, but then let the other person speak. The other person is preoccupied with what they will say when it’s their turn to speak, they will only be partially tuning in to what you’re saying. But by asking the other person questions first, they’ll be much more relaxed and focused when the conversation turns to you (because they’re no longer practicing what to say).</p>
                        <h3>Show Sincerity and Interest</h3>
                        <p>Have a few good questions in your back pocket. Asking the other person about her background and work will show her that you’re interested in <a href="http://www.thedailymuse.com/job-search/4-networking-mistakes-you-dont-know-youre-making/" title="Four Networking Mistakes you don't know You're making" target="_blank">more than just your own job opportunities <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. The best questions are ones that can’t be answered by just “yes” or “no,” such as:</p>
                        <ol class="custom-counter">
                          <li>How do you like working for your company?</li>
                          <li>What’s your primary role at your company?</li>
                          <li>What projects are you working on right now?</li>
                          <li>How did you get involved in your field?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Get to the Point</h3>
                        <p>When it’s your turn to share what you do, state it in <a href="http://www.thedailymuse.com/job-search/perfect-pitch/" title="Perfect Pitch" target="_blank">just 2-3 sentences <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. You can go into greater detail later on, but people will lose interest very quickly if you can’t cut to the chase. Similarly, avoid using jargon (like acronyms or specialist phrases). The key to effectively networking is to build rapport, so if someone can’t understand what you’re talking about, a connection won’t happen.</p>
                        <h3><a href="http://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/notes-verbal.html" title="Note Taking" target="_blank">Take Notes <i class="external-link"></i></a></h3>
                        <p>You may not remember the details of person you speak with, so you may want to write them down in notes. After meeting with a few people, seek out a quiet space to jot some notes on a notepad (or directly on a business card) about who each person is, what you discussed, and any follow-up you plan. Doing so will make following up or future meetings much easier.</p>

                      <h3></h3>
                        <p>How you follow up after events is as important as how you prepare beforehand or what you do during the event. Consider the following <a href="http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/options/extern/upload/HowToFollowupAfterNetworkingEvent.pdf" title="How to Follow Up after a Networking event PDF" target="_blank">15 points on how to effectively follow up <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a>, along with the following:</p>
                        <ul class="fa-ul checklist">
                          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o secondary_text"></i>Sort any business cards you received and record the contact information digitally. Google the contacts and invite them to follow you on social media.</li>
                          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o secondary_text"></i>If you attended an event with presentations or speakers, go over what you learned at the sessions, review your notes and save them electronically. Consider how to connect the themes covered in presentations with current trends, and summarize your notes in a way that means you will be able to recall the information if you encounter them again, or are in a circumstance where the subject comes up.</li>
                          <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o secondary_text"></i>Determine who to follow up with. People that showed enthusiasm when you met in person are a good start; people that you share a common background, interest, or value are another good start. Keep track of these for informational interviewing (see the next topic).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This information and your follow-up will be critically important to growing your network, and transitioning from large events to one-on-one informational interviewing.</p>
