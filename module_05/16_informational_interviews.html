      		<p>Informational interviews are another great way to expand your network. An Informational Interview is a scheduled and formal meeting where you plan to sit down with an employed professional in your field to seek advice on their career, your industry, and the corporate culture of their workplace; while the employed professional learns about you, your journey, and informally judges your professional potential. Informational interviewing is a great way to supplement your research on industry, occupations, and employers. However, informational interviews are not job interviews. Do not ask for a job or bring up that you want a job with the employed professional.</p>
          <h3>Informational interviewing is helpful in the following ways:</h3>
          	<ul>
            	<li>Get firsthand information on your career, industry, field, and employers.</li>
              <li>Learn about others’ career journeys and get ideas about how to chart your own course.</li>
              <li>Get tips about how to prepare for and enter your chosen occupation.</li>
              <li>Practice asking questions and chatting with professionals outside of a formal job interview.</li>
              <li>Learn about organizational culture and norms.</li>
              <li>Get tips on words, phrases, ideas, and trends to include in your cover letter and resume.</li>
              <li>Develop a relationship with someone that may think of you when a posting comes up.</li>
           </ul>
       <p><strong>NOTE: You will need to complete PART D: Informational Interviews of the <a href="documents/networks_and_networking_worksheet.pdf" title="Networks and Networking worksheet PDF" target="_blank">Networks and Networking worksheet <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a> as part of this week’s work.</strong></p>
       <p>Identify informational interviews you have conducted and record relevant information regarding your research, questions, activities, and follow-ups. If you have not yet attended an informational interview, record how you intend to research, engage, and follow-up.</p>
