                      <p>This week&rsquo;s face-to–face class will begin with students sharing their Trumpet or success stories. Students will develop their networking skills when they practice “blowing their own trumpet” in telling a success story about themselves to their classmates. The purpose of this exercise is to give students practice in articulating their strengths (and weaknesses) to potential employers and their circle of influence. They are asked to provide concise examples that prove their point. </p>
                      <h3>Instructions: </h3>
                      	<ol>
                        	<li>Think about a story you can share about a time when you worked really hard or did something great that was difficult for you. These stories are called &quot;Trumpet&quot; or success stories.<br />
                          Write your most meaningful trumpet story. It does not need to be longer than one page. Include enough detail to prove that this situation has impacted your life. Explain why you chose this particular example, how it has impacted your life, and what you have learned or how you have changed because of this triumph in your life. </li>
                          <li>Review your story with three different classmates. Your classmates should provide constructive feedback advising you what skills he/she learned you possess as a result of your story. What values or strengths do they hear in your story? You and your classmate should discuss whether the skills you reveal in your success story are hard skills or soft skills, and if the examples you gave in your story were concise and specific enough to prove your point. Hand-out reference for students on <a href="documents/Soft_and_Hard_Skills.pdf" title="Soft and Hard Skills Handout PDF" target="_blank">soft and hard skills <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a>. </li>
                          <li>Debrief as a large group once everyone has shared his or her story with at least three different people. What was it like to share your trumpet stories with your colleagues? Were any common themes noticed?</li>
                       </ol>
