              <p>Sometimes called a professional body, professional organization, or professional society, a professional association is a non-profit organization seeking to further a particular profession, the interests of individuals engaged in that profession and the public interest.</p>
          </div>
      		<p>When setting out on a career journey, professional associations are an excellent place to learn about your field and its relation to your VIPS (Values, Interests, Personality, Skills), develop awareness of occupations and industries, conduct research on trends and outlook, and begin to network with key industry professionals. Professional associations can also offer powerful opportunities to get involved in specific activities and show your commitment to a career path. All these activities can be useful in generating employment opportunities in the hidden job market.</p>

                        <h2>Finding Professional Associations</h2>
                        <p>There is a professional association for nearly every career and industry. Better yet, many offer students membership rates, and some even have campus chapters. </p>
                        <p>To find your match, see if the career you are interested in has a professional association:</p>
                        	<ul>
                          	<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ccc_bt-rec_ec.nsf/eng/h_00001.html" title="Directory of Business and Trade Associations and Organizations" target="_blank">Directory of Business and Trade Associations/Organizations <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> to look up all business and trade associations. </li>
                            <li>Add the names of professional associations and related thought leaders to Part B of your <a href="documents/networks_and_networking_worksheet.pdf" title="Networks and Networking Worksheet PDF" target="_blank">Networks and Networking Worksheet <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a>. Ensure you bring your completed worksheet to class for further discussion.</li>

                        <h2>Make Yourself Visible</h2>
                        <p>Once you match an association to your interests, make yourself visible. Many associations provide opportunities specifically for student members, which can be incredibly valuable when it comes time to market yourself. They also provide a pathway to forge personal connections. Possible opportunities include:</p>
                        	<ul>
                          	<li>Networking events</li>
                            <li>Conferences</li>
                            <li>Workshops</li>
                            <li>Mentoring programs</li>
                            <li>Job boards</li>
                            <li>Volunteering on a committee</li>
                          </ul>

                        <h2>Make Strategic Connections</h2>
                        <p>Most professional organizations have a social media presence on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and other sites. Consider following them to get a sense of the kind of activities and programs they offer. Other ways to interact include:</p>
                        	<ul>
                          	<li>Following their status updates or tweets</li>
                            <li>Replying, re-tweeting or direct messaging members of the organization</li>
                            <li>Starting or joining a conversation</li>
                            <li>Seeing if they offer Tweetchats or Tweetups and joining</li>
                          </ul>
                        <p>Treat interactions with professional associations the same way you would potential employersâ€”you never know who might turn into a lead.</p>
