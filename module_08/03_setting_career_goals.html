      	<p>Having a clearly defined, specific set of goals will help you on your job search by providing some standards to measure your progress and understand your personal development. We have previously discussed the concept of <a href="../module_02/11_smart_goals.html" title="link to Week 2: Smart Goals topic">SMART goals</a>  to during Week 2 on the topic of Self-Assessment. Review your SMART goal worksheet in preparation for this next section of learning.  </p>
        <p>Setting goals related to your career journey can be broken into three steps:</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
           <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-1">
                <p class="circle circle-sm bg secondary_bg pull-left" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">1.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-11">
                <p class="primary_text lead"><span class="sr-only">1.</span> Decide What You Want to Do</p>
                <p>First, decide your key goal: what you want to be, accomplish, or obtain.</p>
                <h3 class="secondary_text">For example: </h3>
                <p><em>Become an equity partner with a company related to my passion </em></p>
          </div>
     </div>
           <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-1">
                <p class="circle circle-sm bg accent02_bg pull-left" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">2.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-11">
                <p class="primary_text lead"><span class="sr-only">2.</span> Turn It Into Smaller Goals</p>
                <p>Second, split your larger goal into smaller and more achievable objectives that you have to achieve. This will make accomplishing your goal easier to manage and will monitor your progress.</p>
                <h3 class="secondary_text">Continuing the previous example:</h3>
                	<ol>
                  	<li>Graduate from program of study with a 3.5 GPA.</li>
                    <li>Obtain an entry-level position with a company in a field related to my passion.</li>
                    <li>Obtain senior position with a company related to my passion.</li>
                 </ol>
          </div>
     </div>
           <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-1">
                <p class="circle circle-sm bg accent01_bg pull-left" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">3.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-11">
                <p class="primary_text lead"><span class="sr-only">3.</span> Work Towards It</p>
                <p>Finally, you will want to formulate and develop a proper plan for your objectives and goal. It can be best to establish a step by step plan that will enable you to hit each objective on your way to achieving your goal.</p>
                <h3 class="secondary_text">Continuing the previous example:</h3>
                	<p><strong>1a)</strong> Read all modules from current semesterâ€™s courses by end of term.<br />
                  <strong>1b)</strong> Study for exams during study break for a minimum of 20 hours.<br />
                  <strong>1c)</strong> Complete final three assignments a minimum of one week ahead of deadlines.</p>
                  <p><strong>2a)</strong> Use research, trend and LMI analysis to identify 100 key employers related to my passion in expanding markets that will be looking to recruit new grads.<br />
                  <strong>2b)</strong> Attend three networking events and three informational interviews to connect with these key employers in the final three months of my study term.<br />
                  <strong>2c)</strong> Obtain three interview requests from key employers in the month following graduation.</p>
                  <p><strong>3a)</strong> Obtain top marks in employee reviews for each employee review cycle.<br />
                  <strong>3b)</strong> Create a development plan with supervisor for training, experience, opportunities required to become competitive in a senior role.<br />
                  <strong>3c)</strong> Volunteer for at least two service opportunities (e.g., volunteering, committees) within first two years of working in entry-level job.</p>
