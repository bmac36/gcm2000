<p>Having the right attitude for a job search means being positive. The <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/148318?rskey=tQvwM2&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid28912091" title="link to Oxford Dictionary definition of Positive Thinking" target="_blank">Oxford English dictionary <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> formally defines positive thinking as &quot;The practice or result of concentrating one's mind affirmatively on the good and constructive aspects of a matter so as to eliminate negative or destructive attitudes and emotions&quot;. In other words, having a positive attitude means having a favorable outlook, being optimistic, and having good feelings or goodwill in your thoughts and feelings.  </p>
<h3>Positive Attitudes = Positive Outcomes</h3>
<p>People with positive attitudes tend to attract positive outcomes. If you are positive, and express positive thoughts around others, you will be an attractive person to spend time with, and opportunities will materialize. Alternatively, if you are negative or pessimistic, you will be unattractive and have a more difficult time finding opportunities. Your attitude can infect your ability to make a good first impression, write a strong cover letter, or excel at an interview – your verbal and nonverbal interactions will be infused with your attitude. Showing positive traits like honesty, respect, responsibility, care, and work ethic will make you a much more effective job seeker.</p>
<h3>Changing Your Thinking</h3>
<p>If you find yourself struggling to think positively and being optimistic, you may want to consider &quot;reprogramming&quot; your mind to be more positive. Watch this video to learn some methods for doing this:</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Having a positive attitude does not mean that you need to be unnecessarily optimistic or expect that you are about to get a perfect job without any effort. <a href="http://www.careerealism.com/work-expectations/" title="Are your Work expectations realistic?" target="_blank">Being realistic about your job search is important <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. Being realistic means being aware of the actual conditions as they are, not necessarily as you perceive them to be. Being realistic about a job search can mean being aware of industry demands, labour market outlook, your own skills and abilities, probabilities, and timelines.</p>
<h3>Some Sobering Statistics</h3>
<p>Some key stats to be realistic about:</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>An average job search takes between 3-6 months, and professionals with higher skill, education, and salaries usually take longer to secure a job than lower skilled workers. </li>
      <li>Jobs in industries with high turnover are easier to secure than jobs in industries with lower turnover. </li>
      <li>Corporate jobs receive an average of 250 applications per opening.</li>
      <li>Usually about only 2% of applicants receive an interview request.</li>
      <li>Internal transfers and promotions were the source of 51% of all full-time hires in 2009. This is up by 19% from 2006. This means many postings are &quot;false leads&quot;.</li>
      <li>Referrals account for 26.7% of all external hires, and yield an average of one hire for every 15 received. </li>
      <li>Job boards and corporate career sites accounted for 22.3% and 13.2% of new hires respectively, 35.5% in total.</li>
   </ul>
 <h3>Modify Your Expectations</h3>
 <p>Being realistic means that you should not get discouraged if you don’t achieve success right away. Modify your expectations by planning to spend potentially a few months connecting with the right job. Diversify your efforts between different job search techniques to maximize your exposure to the hidden job market and beat the odds. Be resolute amid the “emotional rollercoaster” of highs and lows that go with job search.</p>
