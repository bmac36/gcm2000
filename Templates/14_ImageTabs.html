      <h3>Why should you start your career journey by becoming more aware of yourself? </h3>
      <p>Consider the two job seekers below, each with different levels of self-awareness. </p>
      <p><strong>Click each job seeker to consider what makes one more effective than the other. Then scroll down the page to view a summary.</strong></p>

                        <h3>Job Seeker A</h3>
                        <p>The first job seeker doesn’t know his strengths and weaknesses, and struggles with self-improvement and receiving feedback. This gives him difficulty with teamwork because he doesn’t understand the dimensions of team personality. It also makes it hard for him to identify the jobs that are truly suited to him. He applies for any job posting remotely related to his skill set, sending out dozens of resumes each week. Even though he gets a lot of rejections, he ends each week thinking he accomplished a lot and is ready to follow the same pattern the next week.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane" id="scenario2">
                        <h3>Job Seeker B</h3>
                         <p>The second job seeker has a good sense of his personality, strengths and weaknesses. He is actively working on improving his work performance and is receptive to feedback. Understanding his own personality and preferences helps him to better relate to team members and work well in teams. He targets three specific jobs that he wants to do. He researches which employers in his community can use people for those jobs and focuses his efforts on reaching those employers. This leads to a number of quality conversations with potential employers that turns into two job offers.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Understanding your personality, and your most significant skills and abilities helps you in a variety of areas: self-improvement, teamwork, and the job hunt—just to name a few. Taking the time to increase your self-awareness is definitely worth the effort.</p>
