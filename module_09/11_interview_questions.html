      <h3>How to Respond</h3>
      <p>If you are asked one of these questions, you do not have to answer. In some cases, the employer may not be aware that their question is illegal, but that does not mean that you should answer it. Instead, try to understand why the employer may be asking the question and address the potential concern rather than giving a specific answer to their question.</p>
      <p><strong>Let’s see how Jenn responded when a hiring manager asked her an illegal question.</strong></p>
      <div class="callout">
        <blockquote class="lead"> <img src="../images/mentors/jenn.jpg" class="img-circle circle-med dot-brdr primary-brdr pull-right" alt="Mentor Jenn" />
          <p>Once when I was in an interview, the hiring manager asked me, ‘Do you have children?’ The job I was interviewing for needed somebody to be at work on-time with minimal absences because it provided support to clients. I think the employer was just looking to be reassured that I would be able to do my job and show up, or that I had alternative daycare set up for when my kids would be sick. Still, I did not want to answer the question because it is not legal for them to ask me that. Instead, I responded with, ‘I am not sure why you asked this question, but I can assure you that there will be no concerns with my attendance.’ After my response, the hiring manager realized that the question was illegal, apologized, and thanked me for my answer.</p>
          <p class="small">Jenn</p>
        </blockquote>

      <h3>Additional responses can include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I am not quite sure why you asked that question. Would you please elaborate? </li>
        <li>I don’t feel obligated to answer that particular question as I am not sure what it has to do with the position.</li>
        <li>Why do you ask?</li>
        <li>The answer to that question will in no way affect my ability to do the job.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Try not to be offended or angry in your response, even though the interviewer is breaking the law. Use professionalism and diplomacy to respond politely. </p>
