          <strong>&quot;If you find that you're struggling with identifying your skills and interests, consider taking a career assessment. A career assessment is a tool that helps you to identify your values, personality, interest, and other traits that are important in making a career decision. It can also suggest possible careers based on your profile.&quot;</strong></blockquote>
      <p>There are many assessments on the market that can help you define your career interests. Assessments are meant to be objective tests that ask the same standard questions (usually 50-200 multiple choice) of all participants. The idea is that these produce reliable and predictive results, and don’t discriminate in questions or results (no right or wrong). You will be responsible for taking three online assessments this week. You will also complete one additional assessment in-class.</p>
      <p><strong>Expand the panels below to learn how to complete three online assessments for your Self-Portrait.</strong></p>

                    <p>You know yourself the best. Career assessment tests are suggestive only. Use different tests to affirm what you already know and to highlight additional information about yourself that you may not have considered. Combine this with what you know of yourself (e.g. from your success stories) and the feedback you have received from others to create an accurate picture of who you are today and where you want to contribute in the job market.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Take multiple tests and compare the results.</h3>
                    <p>It’s good practice to compare results from a variety of different tests to ensure you get a more balanced perspective of yourself.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>There are no right or wrong personalities.</h3>
                    <p>Online career assessment tests can help you to appreciate differences between people but keep in mind but there are no right or wrong personality types. No matter what their strengths or limitations, everyone should be treated with care and respect.</p></li>

                    <p>Here are three career assessment tools you will use. Click each one to learn more about it. As part of these week’s activities you will be required to complete all three of these assessments on your own and to summarize your results in your Self-Assessment and Reflection Summary and on your personal blog. It’s important to be authentic when assessing yourself and refrain from judging yourself or others for possessing traits that you deem less desirable. Everyone has value, special strengths and qualities. Completing these assessments will help you to appreciate how much differences between people are often due to personality differences. </p>
                    <p>Be sure to follow instructions and complete all questions honestly. Answer according to what feels right for you, not how you think they should be answered. Detailed technical instructions for completing these assessments are included in the <a href="documents/Self_Assessment_and_Reflection_summary.docx" title="Self-Assessment and Reflection Summary" target="_blank">Self-Assessment and Reflection Summary <i class="fa fa-file-word-o"></i></a>.</p>

                    <p>The Keirsey Temperament Sorter Questionnaire is based on the theory of Dr. David Keirsey, who identified mankind's four basic temperaments as the Artisan, the Guardian, the Rational, and the Idealist. Each temperament has its own unique qualities and shortcomings, strengths and challenges.</p>
