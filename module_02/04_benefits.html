      <h3> It is critically important to be self-aware. </h3>
      <p>Job seekers must be able to articulate their skills and abilities, temperament and preferred work style, passions and values, motivations and goals, and accomplishments and knowledge base in order to interview successfully and land not just any job, but the right job.</p>
      <p><strong>Expand each section below to see why doing a comprehensive self-assessment prior to your job search or career planning is a good idea.</strong></p>

                  <p>Armed with a comprehensive understanding of what you can do as well as how you process information, solve problems, make decisions, and communicate, you'll be able to target positions where you can be the most productive, effective, and satisfied. This allows you to make informed choices and builds your confidence. As opposed to applying for whatever comes along, you can be much more selective, allowing you to expend energy effectively in pursuit of your best job targets.</p>

                    <p>Once you know how your interests, skills, values and personal traits fit with potential jobs, you can find employment in an environment that matches many of your own interests, values and traits. This approach can open up a number of possibilities you may not have considered. Sometimes a career indirectly related to your field of interest turns out to be a better fit than your original career goal.</p>

                            <p>For example, you may have all of the skills necessary to become an excellent analyst. However, if you prefer to be with people and don't enjoy isolation, then you probably wouldn't be happy with that job no matter how qualified you are for the position. At the same time you might find that some of the skills that made you an excellent analyst might also be applicable to project management. Suddenly you find yourself in an associated line of work for the same organization, surrounded by people in a group setting, which you find much more enjoyable.</p>

                    <p>Once you know what you are good at and how these skills and traits match job specifications, you can craft a clear &quot;sales pitch&quot; or job story that clearly explains to a potential employer why you are the best fit. Having this knowledge makes it easier to interview, network, and respond to job postings, when you get to that stage of the job search.</p>
