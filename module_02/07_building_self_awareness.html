      	<p>Making plans for your future can be difficult. Starting with the self-assessment process can give you more choices and increase your confidence that you are on the right career path. A self-assessment can reveal your personal attributes, values, skills, and interests, all of which are critical in helping you make informed career choices that are appropriate for you. Self-reflection is a good starting part for getting to know yourself better.</p>
        <h2>Self-Reflective Questions to Ask Yourself</h2>
        <img src="images/self-assessment.png" class="pull-right" alt="image depicting self-reflective questions to ask yourself section" width="50%" />
        <p>Start by examining your interests, strengths, and traits. Ask yourself: </p>
        	<ul>
          	<li>What do I do well? </li>
            <li>What do I enjoy doing? </li>
            <li>What do others tell me about myself? </li>
            <li>What energizes me? </li>
            <li>What am I passionate about?</li>
         </ul>
       <p>Answers to these questions will help you identify your strengths and make decisions around the contributions you can make. Many people try to conform to jobs advertised in newspapers or other sources. However, employers today have many qualified candidates from whom to choose. You will be seriously considered for a position only if you demonstrate that you know who you are, what you can offer, and where you are going.</p>

We played sudden death games against 11 other teams and came out on top. We even got to travel to Toronto to play in the championship game at BMO Field! I loved feeling like a sports star. When we won, the entire team got to lift up a huge trophy together. I loved being a part of such a great team!&quot;</strong></p>

I was able to point out that this could be done electronically, using simple database technology. I created a basic model and presented it to the groupâ€™s organizer, who loved it and decided to give me a paid position developing the system.&quot;</strong></p>
